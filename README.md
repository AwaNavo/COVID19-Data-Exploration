# COVID-19 Data Exploration

In this project, I performed an  exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a global COVID-19 dataset using Microsoft SQL Server. 
The goal was to extract meaningful insights about the pandemic’s spread, mortality rates, and vaccination progress across different countries.
This project strengthened my ability to work with real-world datasets, and produce structured insights that support data-driven decision making.
